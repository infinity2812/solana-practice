# anchor-project

Simple Anchor workspace with a `gm` program to print a greeting. This repository mirrors the structure created by `anchor init` without requiring any commands to be run.

- Program: `programs/gm`
- Tests: `tests/gm.ts`
- Client template: `client/index.ts`

Replace the placeholder program id `11111111111111111111111111111111` in `programs/gm/src/lib.rs` and in `Anchor.toml` once you generate keys.
